# prediction-age-from-DNA
DNA methylation-based estimators and classifiers are widely used to estimate a range of variables such as telomere length (TL), disease diagnosis, smoking status and body mass index (BMI). In several studies DNA methylation and chronological age have been discovered to be strongly correlated. Penalized regression methods, especially elastic net, have grown in popularity for predicting specific outcomes in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). This report aims to improve age prediction by minimizing prediction error for chronological age using publicly available data and comparing it to existing models. We expect that the enhanced prediction accuracy for chronological age and the innovative epigenetic clock developed will help to address a wide range of questions in developmental biology, cancer, and aging research.
We will explore the DNA methylation datasets ranging from 46 to 689 par- ticipants and with 25,000 CpGs per cohort. First, we compare the penalized regression models and explain why we chose elastic regression. The accuracy is then enhanced by parameter adjustment and PCA, a feature selection approach. Finally, we discuss the model effect in terms of age range and gender, and we identify a non-linear relationship between epigenetic and chronological age.
